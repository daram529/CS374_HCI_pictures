## Written protocol :

###Instructions for preparation and setting up the testing environment:  

* Prepare Android Phone (Galaxy 8/9. Jiyoun's)
* Open URL (https://bzduck.github.io)
* Have laptops ready to write down the notes on google documents
* Read the introduction to the interviewee
* Start recording the screen (and voice) before starting the interview 
* Get ready to take photos of the interviewee as the interview is being conducted. 

###Actual Introduction Read to the interviewees and the process:  

1. (Alternating) **One person** greets the participant, and buys them a drink.
2. **Facilitator** : 안녕하세요. 저희가 이 실험 내용을 학교 프로젝트 목적으로 사용하려고 하는데, 진행하시는 스크린과 목소리를 녹음할 예정입니다. 또한, 프로토타입을 사용하고 계시는 사진 한장을 찍을 예정인데요, 개인정보는 어떠한 경우에도 노출 하지 않을 것 입니다. 동의 하시나요?
3. **Participant** : 동의합니다. agrees / disagrees 
4. **Facilitator** : 그러면 지금부터 실험 진행하겠습니다. **(Turns on screen recording)** 먼저 설명부터 드리자면 저희 프로토타입은 바빠서 직접 컨텐츠를 찾아볼 시간이 없는 kpop 아이돌 팬들이 현재 감정상태에 따라서 맞는 동영상 컨텐츠를 소비할 수 있게끔 해주는 서비스입니다. (Explanation about our prototype)
* 저희의 프로토타입을 가지고 해주셔야 하는건 총 3개인데요, 프로토타입을 사용하시면서 생각하는걸 말씀하면서 해주세요. (There are three tasks to complete with our prototype. Please think aloud as you interact with the prototype.) 
1. 우선 좋아하는 아이돌을 골라서 회원가입부터 하신 후에 현재 감정상태를 고른 후 그에 맞는 동영상 컨텐츠를 3개 보시면 돼요. 각 동영상은 다 볼 필요는 없고, 그냥 몇초만 보셔도 됩니다. (First, Sign up with your favorite idol group. Then, interact and filter for three contents that pertains to your current emotional state. (save, filter by emotion, swipe through)) 
2. 그 중 가장 좋아하는 동영상을 찾고, 그 동영상에 대해서 다른 사람들이 만들어 놓은 짤 들을 보시면 돼요. 가장 좋아하는 짤을 찾아서 라이크나 다운로드해보시면 됩니다. (Go to "jjal" at your favorite video and look through all the comments. Find your favorite comment and show it by either liking or downloading it)
3. 마지막으로 직접 짤을 만들어보시면 됩니다. (Create a jjal comment for a video that best complemented your emotion that you want to share)
5. While **participant** completes the tasks, facilitator gives feedback to guide/remind them about their tasks. **Observers** writes their talk-aloud and interesting behavior, and **photographer** takes photos of them.
6. After the experiment, the **observers** and the **facilitator** asks the participant to recall back on their interesting behaviors, and ask qualitative / quantitative questions on reflecting their application usage. 
7. (Alternating) **One person** sends the participant their money.
8. **Facilitator :** 수고하셨습니다. Thank you for your contribution. Your contributions will be used to generate a better experience for kpop newbies who are trying to use our platform, in application-specific, and culture-incubating way. 
9. **Everyone** thanks the participant.

## Session Observations

After we changed out POV, we wanted to test our product to people from various age groups. So, we recruited one high school student, one university student and a researcher 

**P1: Male / HS student / 17 / Joy (Red Velvet)/  0.0 hr per day**  

* Posted on a high school’s ‘대신 전해 드립니다’ FB page.  
* He is a representative target user because he’s very busy studying as a high school students and doesn’t have enough time to search for contents at all. Only use phones at home after school.
* He has very little time per each day. He had a flip phone to use during the day, and a smartphone for entertainment purposes during the night. As he was accustomed to smartphones and other applications, he gave a natural think aloud when using our interface.

**P2: Male / Univ Student / 22 / Sana (Twice) / 4~5 hr per week**  

* Recruited via advertisement on Ara  
* He is a representative target user in that although he has a need to consume as many contents as possible, he only consume what’s given through facebook. He occasionally searches Twice’s music videos on Naver.
* He was a typical user who only consumed the star contents when he wanted to, via different mediums with different purposes. He doesn’t consume different contents at different emotional states (“You know, you like seeing people who smile. [Not when they’re crying]”)

**P3: Female / researcher / 35 / Kang Daniel (Wanna One)  / 2~3 hr per day**  

* Recruited via advertisement on Ara  
* She is a representative target user in that she is a busy researcher also working for a startup company. She used lots of time fangirling, but did not have a concrete strategy to look for the exact video, which was why we thought she was a newbie.

## Usability Issues
### Learnability: 
1. User swipes horizontally for jjal. Especially critical when there was only one jjal so that the next jjal wasn’t visible vertically. (P1, P3) (LOW)  
**(Solution) →** Users could easily find out that it swipes vertically after a few trials. Since most apps mix horizontal and vertical swipes, it is not a critical issue.
2. Low affordance for “making jjal” button -- users found it odd that there is a different button in the same position, under different states (paused, playing). (P1, P2, P3) (HIGH)  
**(Solution) →** We are going to separate ‘making jjal’ button from ‘starring’ button and have two buttons in the same spot. The ‘starring’ button will always be available, while ‘making jjal’ button will be only abled when paused since it is capturing the frame out of the video and has to be in paused mode.
3. No affordance for starred videos in Profile page, though the participants easily figured it out. (P2) (LOW)  
**(Solution) →** Have a title “Starred Video” in Profile page
4. Some users didn’t notice the text button when making the jjal, and proceed to share without adding any text. (P1) (MEDIUM)  
**(Solution) →** currently, the text button is hard to notice. Change the icon to be more noticeable.
5. Don’t know how much it fast forwards and reverses (P1) (LOW)  
**(Solution) →** change current icon to one with a number (how many seconds it fast forwards and reverses).
6. No visual feedback for swiping when wifi was slow (P1, P2) (MEDIUM)  
**(Solution) →** have a visual feedback showing if it’s swiped left/right.
7. Lower information scent : No title for the video, maybe display title when video buffering? (P2) (HIGH)  
**(Solution) →** display title on the navigation.

### Efficiency: 
1. The overlay makes it difficult to pause the video on the right moment, as it decreases its visibility. (P1) (MEDIUM)  
**(Solution) →** have a control bar (video navigation) so that they can go to the ‘right’ moment at paused mode
2. When users ‘like’ a jjal, the page refreshes and users are directed to the top. This makes it difficult for the user to trace back to the jjal. (P1, P2, P3) (MEDIUM)  
**(Solution) →** change it to stay at current position (change current ‘a tag’ to ‘div’)

### Safety: 
1. When going back from Profile, it’s not the same video (P2) (MEDIUM)  
**(Solution) →** make it go back to the same video.


### High level reflections:

* Prepare perfect environment setting, especially Wifi. In all of the three interviews, we have very weak Wifi connection and it affected video streaming when swiping. It was also highly due to the fact that the set times in the cafe were highly congested hours of internet consumption. 
* Prepare as many and various questions as possible. Some interviewees (P1 and P3) were different from what we expected and couldn’t ask prepared questions.
* We need to break the ice so that the interviewees feel more comfortable. (some were unwilling to talk about some details about how they consume the idols or the kpop culture itself because of the stereotypes/connotations with kpops, and because consumption of kpop contents many times very personal)
		
		
## Studio Reflections  


#### Feedback from the studio session includes:

 
**Students' comments**

*  xx 
**(answer) →** xx


**TA’s comments**

* xx 
**(reflection) →** xx

* xx
**(reflection) →** xx


## Plan for iteration:  

**Reflect back upon comments from the users and apply any feedback to the high-level experience of the application, as needed**  
Comments from the users :  

* Change the ‘making jjal’ button 
* Visual feedback for swiping left/right
* When like a “jjal”, page stays where it is now
* include title in the navigation
* have a variety of videos that match to each emotional state
* have the same video when go back from Profile page
* have a title(“Starred video”) at Profile page
* Include a control bar for the video
* Change the fast forward and reverse icons
